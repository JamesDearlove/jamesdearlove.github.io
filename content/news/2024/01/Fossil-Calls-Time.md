Fossil Group have been making Wear OS watches for some time, arguably keeping WearOS alive for many years when Google and Samsung didn't. They've formally announced today that they are leaving the sector, after not releasing new hardware since 2021 and rumours of Gen 7 watches coming last year that never materialised.

Now with Google actually working on Wear OS, Samsung jumping back to Wear OS, and probably poor sales when the competitors watches were just better, they probably feel that it's just not worth competing anymore. The smartwatch scene continues to be dominated by Apple, with Samsung and Garmin still keeping up and the Pixel Watch probably on at least 2 people's wrists.
