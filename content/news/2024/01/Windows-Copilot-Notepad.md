Because nothing is sacred, now notepad will soon come with AI.

I don't get it. Notepad was one of the best simple apps on Windows, opened fast, always reliable, and was just easy to open to jot a quick note into. Windows 11 ruined that, my work laptop refuses to even start Notepad anymore and I could not care Microsoft's internal requirement to get their Windows 11 design language into absolutely everything. If you need an alternative for Windows, a colleague recommended [Notepads](https://www.notepadsapp.com/) and it is so much better.
