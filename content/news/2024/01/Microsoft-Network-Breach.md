On the back of Microsoft's previous major security incident (known as Storm-0558) and their pledge to bringing their security up to snuff, Microsoft has revealed they've had a Kremlin-backed hacking group break into their network.

tl;dr is that they managed to use a password spray attack to get into a test account, which somehow led to access to some of Microsoft's executive email accounts. That is quite an impressive storyline based the fact that this suggests there was no MFA, a test account had or could gain executive account access, the test account was not removed after the test, and that these hackers were within the network for **seven** weeks.

Welcome to the modern age, expect to see this a lot more often. Security is in reality an illusion and just a deterrent.
