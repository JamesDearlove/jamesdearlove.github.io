The Apple Vision Pro headset finally has a release date, and what seems like no clear market that it is marketed to. The device looks quite technically impressive as many tech journalists say the device's demos are remarkable, but its pricetag of $3500USD leaves many questioning who will pick up the first gen unit. It's not uncommon for Apple to release a product and take a few years to figure out who it is for, the iPad and Apple Watch are key examples of this.

Preorders for the headset begin on Jan 19th and release on Feb 2nd in the US only. Apple have also released their [first ad for the headset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqTIB_q40bo) which is quite similar in style to their [Hello ad for the original iPhone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmiWTKZzBLY).

Time will tell if this headset will actually change things again, but I'll wait for the next generation (and actual availability here) before even considering it.
