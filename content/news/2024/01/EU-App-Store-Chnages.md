The day is finally almost upon us, iOS 17.4 will finally allow third party app stores and side-loading for regular users. But Apple plays the card everyone was expecting, most of the changes announced are only available in the EU and with considerable terms. 

Here's a summary of what's changing:

- EU, apps can be side-loaded now but need to be "notarized" by Apple. This is a similar process to getting past default security settings on Mac, and is basically a process to scan for malware and block apps remotely if they are found to be malicious.
- EU, alternative app stores can be side-loaded, but also require going through an explicit Apple approval process.
- EU, a Core Technology charge of â‚¬0.50 is being introduced for all apps (including free apps) with an EU annual install of over 1 million installs, if the developer adopts the EU agreement.
- EU, apps that use an alternative IAP payments system will now only pay 17% fees to Apple, and 10% for "small business" accounts.
- EU, alternative browser engines to WebKit (aka Safari) will be allowed and first time Safari runs will ask if you want a different browser.
- EU, NFC payments will be opened up for alternatives to Apple Pay. 
- Globally, game streaming apps like GeForce Now and Game Pass Cloud are now allowed onto the app store.

All in all, interesting times ahead and this could be the start of seeing this roll out globally and a lot more fighting over some of these changes. Developers are skeptical, big tech is still furious and finding many holes in these changes, and most consumers still couldn't care less.
