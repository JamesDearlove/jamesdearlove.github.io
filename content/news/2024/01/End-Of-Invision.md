InVision was once the pioneer for UX prototyping before Figma came along and have today announced that they are shutting down their services by the end of this year. It appears that they just never could innovate past their original prototyping software which for the time was very good.

It's been a while since I actually have seen InVision in the wild, using it back in its day for random UI protoypes. Apps like Figma and Sketch well surpassed it in useful features and with their attempt at catching up InVision Studio being lacklustre and full of bugs, Figma and Sketch became the industry apps that everyone defaulted to.
