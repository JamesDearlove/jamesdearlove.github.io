For a while now, I've been summarising some of the more interesting and noteworthy stories I come across and posting them into a private Discord server. This has been quite a fun exercise, so I've decided to publish them here for anyone who is interested. Most posts are short, and have commentary from myself as well as explanations of lesser known tech things to help provide better context.

I personally read most news via RSS, and have an RSS feed for this archive which you can [subscribe to here](/news/index.xml).
