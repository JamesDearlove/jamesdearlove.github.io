In fediverse news from today, news aggregation app Flipboard has announced it's also going to start supporting federating content into the fediverse with ActivityPub. And not by a little bit either, it sounds like Flipboard is rewriting their entire backend to use ActivityPub which will lead to potentially much more good news content being available in the Fediverse. As with Threads, they are starting the rollout with a handful of publications and are working on how content moderation will work.

Honestly I forgot Flipboard still existed, but it's very cool to see other systems embrace ActivityPub as the internet attempts to embrace the idea that centralisation might not be as good as big tech wants you to think.
