Cast yourself back to the era before 64-bit Windows and you'll find that `edit` was the default CLI editor included in DOS and Windows (16 & 32-bit). That's right, 32-bit Windows 10 still has that editor included. Nowadays Windows 11 dropped support for 32-bit processors and everyone has been running 64-bit for some time, so Windows doesn't come with a CLI editor preinstalled but that might soon change. Discussion has started on the Windows Terminal repo around if people want to see a default CLI editor and which they may like to see.

With notepad no longer being the ye ol reliable in Windows 11, sometimes taking way too long to load, it's about time that we see the rise of a CLI based editor just being available for quick config changes and PowerShell remoting into other machines.
