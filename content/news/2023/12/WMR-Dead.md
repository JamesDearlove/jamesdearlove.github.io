Microsoft has put the writing on the wall for the Windows Mixed Reality platform, adding it to their deprecated features list today. The platform has seen very little in updates in the past couple of years, with no new hardware from OEMs in years. The VR team has been slowly shrinking, so this really is no big surprise as Microsoft pivots to innovating with work in the :stars: metaverse :stars:

There has been calls to open source the code for WMR, something that likely will never happen from Microsoft. In the meantime, I'm hoping that my WMR headset doesn't turn into a paperweight or more likely I'll just keep running Windows 10.
