Beeper has made a last ditch effort to get iMessage working the way they were intending, and have said they have no plans to fix it again if Apple (very likely) bricks this method as well. Well, kinda. It now requires owning a jailbroken iPhone and Mac or Linux computer to work which is a far cry from the original vision of Beeper Mini.

Apple have made their stance about their super secure and privacy focused iMessage very clear, own an iPhone. And it looks like any more medaling from Beeper may get them in trouble with by Uncle Sam for unauthorised access and other various laws. 

Beeper have also decided to open source their bridge implementation in response to claims that about it being "insecure". For now Beeper says they will return back to their vision of building the best chat app, which as for myself I'd love to see some needed polish to smooth out the small rough edges in their apps.
