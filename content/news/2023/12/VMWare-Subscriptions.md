In "software going to shit" news, after the purchase of VMware by Broadcom, you can now expect to never own a piece of VMware by Broadcom server software perpetually ever again. Yes VMware by Broadcom is how to refer to them now. It appears that Broadcom wants to almost double VMware's earnings from $4.7 billion to $8.5 billion over the next 3 years and after layoffs this is the next stage of the plan.

The change applies immediately, so hopefully you didn't need a vSAN, vCloud, or vSphere license today. Existing support contracts will be honoured, but this is an absolute terrible decision for everyone except Broadcom shareholders.

You will not own anything and you will love it.
