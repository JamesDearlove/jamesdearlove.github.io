Google has been "behind" in the AI game since OpenAI threw down the gauntlet with GPT-3 and DALL-E, but Google's latest AI model Gemini looked very promising. Or at least it did until their video presentation presenting someone drawing a duck, and the model saying it was a duck using text to speech turned out to be fabricated.

Google seemingly implied through the presentation and a bit of video editing, that the AI model could be doing this on the fly processing the video and giving this result. But AI experts were quick to point out that would be currently computationally impossible. A Google spokesperson said that "the user's voiceover is all real excerpts from the actual prompts used to produce the Gemini output that follows."

It appears that Google are still playing catchup, probably by hyping up things a little too much and therefore making their stock price look good. With all that said, the image recognition capabilities of Gemini of a still image could still be very impressive.
