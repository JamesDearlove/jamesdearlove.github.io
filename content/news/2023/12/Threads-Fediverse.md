Slightly older but arguably important news that Meta has officially started public testing of their integration of ActivityPub, making it the first time that Facebook/Meta has actually done something for the good of the internet in years.

Head of Instagram & Threads, Adam Mosseri, has shared Thread's plans for rolling out fediverse integration over the next year. It includes interoperability with other apps that use ActivityPub, meaning that you could soon be able to follow people who don't directly use Threads on Threads, as well as moving your account to a different app/server. For now it is just a couple of Threads team members, but they promise to be working towards a wider rollout soon.

**But wait, what is ActivityPub? (a tl;dr)** ActivityPub is an open protocol that promotes the idea of decentralised delivery of content. Essentially meaning that you could post something on one application and it could appear on someone else's application without much fuss. It is the underlying system for how Mastodon works, being able to join almost any server and federate content from other servers. For example, as I am a user of Mastodon server hachyderm.io I can still get content and follow others from other servers like mastodon.social, or tech.lgbt as they federate with each other. It also isn't limited to social circles either, tech news site The Verge will be looking at implementing it fully in the future. A community member has made one after a challenge was made on The Vergecast at theverge.space (and for now has the editor in chief Nilay's blessing)

It is an exciting time to see changes in the open and public web, and could see social media get slightly less shit.
