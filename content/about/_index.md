Hi I'm James, many call me Jimmy.

Currently I'm a Senior Software Developer at the [Department of Environment, Tourism, Science and Innovation, Queensland](https://science.desi.qld.gov.au), where I build, manage, and maintain various science apps and systems within the department.

I studied a Bachelor of Computer Science at [The University of Queensland (UQ)](https://uq.edu.au), and spent much of my free time at uni helping run the [UQ Computing Society](https://uqcs.org) where I still help maintain some of their [open source projects](https://github.com/uqcomputingsociety) today.

Outside of the computing world I love camping, baking, travelling, and watching a lot of animation.
